# Introduction

*iSEE* is a Bioconductor package designed to produce interactive web applications for the visualisation of biological assays (@fig-iSEE).

Initiated in 2017 with single-cell RNA-sequencing in mind, *iSEE* was designed in such a way that it naturally handles any biological assay that can be stored in a rectangular matrix of features (in rows) and samples (in columns).

What makes *iSEE* stand out from other interactive web-application is its focus on the *SummarizedExperiment* class (@fig-SummarizedExperiment), a data structure is widely used throughout the Bioconductor project, from bulk to single-cell experiments.

The well-defined and stable *SummarizedExperiment* data structure makes it easy for *iSEE* to automatically detect information commonly stored in dedicated components of *SummarizedExperiment* objects and display that information in a range of interactive panels, including tables and plots.
