    "text": "iSEE is a Bioconductor package designed to produce interactive web applications for the visualisation of biological assays (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The iSEE app interface, for an example data set.\n\n\nInitiated in 2017 with single-cell RNA-sequencing in mind, iSEE was designed in such a way that it naturally handles any biological assay that can be stored in a rectangular matrix of features (in rows) and samples (in columns).\nWhat makes iSEE stand out from other interactive web-application is its focus on the SummarizedExperiment class (Figure 1.2), a data structure that is widely used throughout the Bioconductor project, from bulk to single-cell experiments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the SummarizedExperiment class (reproduced from the vignette of the SummarizedExperiment package).\n\n\nThe well-defined and stable SummarizedExperiment data structure makes it easy for iSEE to automatically detect information commonly stored in dedicated components of SummarizedExperiment objects and display that information in a range of interactive panels, including tables and plots."

Based on the information available and a set of eight core panel types designed to display different pieces of information, the iSEE() function automatically populates the interface with one panel of each type for which the relevant information is available.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: First row of panel in the iSEE app interface, for an example data set.\n\n\nThe example code given in the help page of the iSEE() function produces an iSEE app that showcases all eight core panel types. For simplicity, Figure 2.2 displays only the main component of each of those eight core panel types, for an example data set. Additional components accompanying each panel and the purpose of each panel will be discussed in a separate chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reduced dimension plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Row data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Feature assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Column data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Row data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Sample assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Column data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h) Complex heatmap plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Main component the eight core panel type in the iSEE package, in their default configuration."

It may also include the possibility of faceting the plot by discrete variables along each axis, and further customisation of non-data elements of the plot such as axis labels and the plot legend.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: The Visual parameters box of the Reduced dimension plot panel, expanded and configured to reveal the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, and ‘Facet’ sections of its contents.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Selection parameters\nThe Selection parameters collapsible box contains interactive elements that control the transmission and usage of selections in each panel.\nThat is typically the name of another panel to receive a selection from and whether to restrict data points in the current panel to those selected in the other panel It may also include the possibility of saving and deleting saved selections made in the current panel.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: The Selection parameters box of the Reduced dimension plot panel, expanded to reveal its contents."
