    "text": "iSEE is a Bioconductor package designed to produce interactive web applications for the visualisation of biological assays (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The iSEE app interface.\n\n\nInitiated in 2017 with single-cell RNA-sequencing in mind, iSEE was designed in such a way that it naturally handles any biological assay that can be stored in a rectangular matrix of features (in rows) and samples (in columns).\nWhat makes iSEE stand out from other interactive web-application is its focus on the SummarizedExperiment class (Figure 1.2), a data structure is widely used throughout the Bioconductor project, from bulk to single-cell experiments.\nThe well-defined and stable SummarizedExperiment data structure makes it easy for iSEE to automatically detect information commonly stored in dedicated components of SummarizedExperiment objects and display that information in a range of interactive panels, including tables and plots.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the SummarizedExperiment class (reproduced from the vignette of the SummarizedExperiment package)."
