    "text": "iSEE is a Bioconductor package designed to produce interactive web applications for the visualisation of biological assays (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The iSEE app interface, for an example data set.\n\n\nInitiated in 2017 with single-cell RNA-sequencing in mind, iSEE was designed in such a way that it naturally handles any biological assay that can be stored in a rectangular matrix of features (in rows) and samples (in columns).\nWhat makes iSEE stand out from other interactive web-application is its focus on the SummarizedExperiment class (Figure 1.2), a data structure that is widely used throughout the Bioconductor project, from bulk to single-cell experiments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the SummarizedExperiment class (reproduced from the vignette of the SummarizedExperiment package).\n\n\nThe well-defined and stable SummarizedExperiment data structure makes it easy for iSEE to automatically detect information commonly stored in dedicated components of SummarizedExperiment objects and display that information in a range of interactive panels, including tables and plots."

Based on the information available and a set of eight core panel types designed to display different pieces of information, the iSEE() function automatically populates the interface with one panel of each type for which the relevant information is available.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: First row of panel in the iSEE app interface, for an example data set.\n\n\nThe example code given in the help page of the iSEE() function produces an iSEE app that showcases all eight core panel types. For simplicity, Figure 2.2 displays only the main component of each of those eight core panel types, for an example data set. Additional components accompanying each panel and the purpose of each panel will be discussed in a separate chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reduced dimension plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Row data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Feature assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Column data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Row data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Sample assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Column data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h) Complex heatmap plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Main component the eight core panel type in the iSEE package, in their default configuration."

In practice, you will produce those objects through your own scripts and workflows."
