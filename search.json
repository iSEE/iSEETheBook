    "text": "iSEE is a Bioconductor package designed to produce interactive web applications for the visualisation of biological assays (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The iSEE app interface.\n\n\nInitiated in 2017 with single-cell RNA-sequencing in mind, iSEE was designed in such a way that it naturally handles any biological assay that can be stored in a rectangular matrix of features (in rows) and samples (in columns).\nWhat makes iSEE stand out from other interactive web-application is its focus on the SummarizedExperiment class (Figure 1.2), a data structure is widely used throughout the Bioconductor project, from bulk to single-cell experiments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the SummarizedExperiment class (reproduced from the vignette of the SummarizedExperiment package).\n\n\nThe well-defined and stable SummarizedExperiment data structure makes it easy for iSEE to automatically detect information commonly stored in dedicated components of SummarizedExperiment objects and display that information in a range of interactive panels, including tables and plots."

    "text": "In this chapter, we describe the contents and layout of a standard iSEE app.\nSpecifically, we focus on the appearance of the interactive point-and-click interface presented to end-users who come to simply explore the data set without any programming knowledge required.\nIllustrative screenshots are taken from the iSEE app produced by the example code given in the help page of the iSEE() function, which can be access from an R console by typing either help(iSEE) or ?iSEE.\nUnder entirely default settings, data sets loaded into the iSEE app are automatically parsed for standard information stored in SummarizedExperiment objects. Based on the information available and a set of eight core panel types designed to display different pieces of information, the iSEE() function automatically populates the interface with one panel of each type for which the relevant information is available.\nThe example code given in the help page of the iSEE() function produces an iSEE app that showcases all eight core panel types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reduced dimension plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Row data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Feature assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Column data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Row data plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Sample assay plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Column data table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h) Complex heatmap plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Core panel types in the iSEE package."
