# The user interface

In this chapter, we describe the contents and layout of a standard *iSEE* app.

Specifically, we focus on the appearance of the interactive point-and-click interface presented to end-users who come to simply explore the data set without any programming knowledge required.

Illustrative screenshots are taken from the *iSEE* app produced by the example code given in the help page of the `iSEE()` function,
which can be access from an *R* console by typing either `help(iSEE)` or `?iSEE`.

Under entirely default settings, data sets loaded into the *iSEE* app are automatically parsed for standard information stored in *SummarizedExperiment* objects.
Based on the information available and a set of eight core panel types designed to display different pieces of information, the `iSEE()` function automatically populates the interface with one panel of each type for which the relevant information is available.

The example code given in the help page of the `iSEE()` function produces an *iSEE* app that showcases all eight core panel types:

:::

Each core panel type is designed to display a different piece of information stored in the object.
The purpose of each panel will be discussed in a separate chapter.
