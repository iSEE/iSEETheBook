# The user interface

## Overview

In this chapter, we describe the contents and layout of a standard *iSEE* app.

Specifically, we focus on the appearance of the interactive point-and-click interface presented to end-users who come to simply explore the data set without any programming knowledge required.

Illustrative screenshots are taken from the *iSEE* app produced by the example code given in the help page of the `iSEE()` function,
which can be access from an *R* console by typing either `help(iSEE)` or `?iSEE`.

## Panels

Under entirely default settings, data sets loaded into the *iSEE* app are automatically parsed for standard information stored in *SummarizedExperiment* objects.
Based on the information available and a set of eight core panel types designed to display different pieces of information, the `iSEE()` function automatically populates the interface with one panel of each type for which the relevant information is available.

The example code given in the help page of the `iSEE()` function produces an *iSEE* app that showcases all eight core panel types:

Each core panel type is designed to display a different piece of information stored in the object.
The purpose of each panel will be discussed in a separate chapter.

## Actions

Once the panels are loaded into the interface, users are free to interact with the interface in any way they see fit.

### Scrolling

Use the mouse wheel, trackpad, or directional arrows (up and down), to scroll up and down the interface, to bring panels into view.

Horizontal scrolling is not possible in *Shiny* apps.

![Scrolling up and down the app interface.](figures/action-scroll.gif){#fig-scrolling}

There is no limit to the number of panels that may be added to the *iSEE* user interface.

Meanwhile, no more than 12 panels may be displayed on a single row -- one panel per unit in the 12-unit layout of pages produced by the *shiny* package -- with rows being filled from left to right and panels exceeding the 12-unit layout being naturally pushed to new rows.

### Collabsible boxes

Click on the header of collapsible boxes located under the panel output, to reveal interactive elements controlling various aspects of the contents displayed in each panel.

### Selection inputs

Click on dropdown elements to reveal their choices.
Click a different choice to see the panel output change accordingly.

### Checkboxes

Click on checkboxes to toggle any number of mutually-compatible parameters.

## Collapsible boxes of parameters

### Data parameters

The *Data parameters* collapsible box contains interactive elements that control the nature of the observations displayed in each panel.

For plots, that is typically the choice of variables shown along each axis.

For tables, that is typically the subset of columns *hidden* in the panel.

### Visual parameters

The *Visual parameters* collapsible box contains interactive elements that control the appearance of data points and non-data elements of panels that produce a plot.

That is typically, the color, shape, size, and opacity of data points.
It may also include the possibility of faceting the plot by discrete variables along each axis,
and further customisation of non-data elements of the plot such as axis labels and the plot legend.
